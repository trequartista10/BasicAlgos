/**
 * You are given N round clocks.
 Every clock has M hands, and these hands can point to positions 1, 2, 3, ..., P (yes, these represent numbers around each face). The clocks are represented by the matrix A consisting of N rows and M columns of integers. The first row represents the hands of the first clock, and so on.
 For example, you are given matrix A consisting of five rows and two columns, and P = 4:
 A[0][0] = 1    A[0][1] = 2
 A[1][0] = 2    A[1][1] = 4
 A[2][0] = 4    A[2][1] = 3
 A[3][0] = 2    A[3][1] = 3
 A[4][0] = 1    A[4][1] = 3

 You can rotate the clocks to obtain several clocks that look identical. For example, if you rotate the third, fourth and fifth clocks you can obtain the following clocks:

 After rotation, you have four pairs of clocks that look the same: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5) and (3, 4).
 Write a function:
 class Solution { public int solution(int[][] A, int P); }
 that, given a zero-indexed matrix A consisting of N rows and M columns of integers and integer P, returns the maximal number of pairs of clocks that can look the same after rotation.
 For example, given the following array A and P = 4:
 A[0][0] = 1     A[0][1] = 2
 A[1][0] = 2     A[1][1] = 4
 A[2][0] = 4     A[2][1] = 3
 A[3][0] = 2     A[3][1] = 3
 A[4][0] = 1     A[4][1] = 3
 the function should return 4, as explained above.
 Assume that:
 N is an integer within the range [1..500];
 M is an integer within the range [1..500];
 P is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
 each element of matrix A is an integer within the range [1..P];
 the elements of each row of matrix A are all distinct.
 Complexity:
 expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*M*log(N*M));
 expected worst-case space complexity is O(N*M).
